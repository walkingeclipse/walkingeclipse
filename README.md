<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!</h1> 

<p> Iâ€™m Mercedez aka WalkingEclipse, a cybersecurity graduate with a B.S. in Cybersecurity and a minor in Penetration Testing. I just earned my Security+ certification and am paving my way into the field by further expanding my knowledge and technical skills. My journey into cybersecurity started with a profound curiosity about how technology works and a deep concern for the increasing threats in cyberspace. This led me to deeply explore various areas as a means to understand, detect, and mitigate vulnerabilities that could compromise data and systems. Follow my journey as I share what Iâ€™m learning, the projects I tackle, and the cybersecurity challenges I conquer along the way! </p>
